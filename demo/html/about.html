  <h2>Overview of the Solid-UI Tabs Component</h2>

<p>
Define a set of tabs in RDF or point to local or remote RDF data you want to display as a set of tabs.  Then inject the tabs into a web page with an HTML widget.
</p>
<p>
To see how simple the process can be, look in the <b>RDF</b> and <b>HTML</b> tabs - they contain the complete code used to display the tabset you are viewing now.
</p>
<p>
To learn how to create & style horizontal and vertical tabsets, see the <b>Create RDF</b> and <b>Create HTML</b> tabs.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Advanced Usage</b> tab has instructions on creating custom actions on tab opening or closing and on using alternate ontologies and data structures.
